{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# CrewAI Flows Explained\n","\n","CrewAI Flows streamline the creation and management of AI workflows. They provide a structured way to connect multiple tasks, **manage state**, and control the execution flow within AI applications, enabling the development of sophisticated AI automations.\n","\n","## Key Concepts & Features\n","\n","* **State Management:** Manage and share data (state) between different tasks. Flows support both unstructured (flexible `state` attribute) and structured (using Pydantic `BaseModel` for type safety) state management.\n","* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Flows use an event-driven model for dynamic and responsive workflow execution.\n","\n","\n","----\n","\n","\n","* **Workflow Orchestration:** Define and manage multi-step processes, coordinating coding tasks and AI Crews.\n","* **Simplified Creation:** Easily chain multiple Crews and tasks together to build complex workflows.\n","\n","* **Flexible Control Flow:** Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within workflows.\n","* **Persistence:** Use the `@persist` decorator (at class or method level) for automatic state persistence, maintaining flow state across restarts or different executions.\n","\n","## Key Components (Decorators & Functions)\n","\n","Flows utilize specific decorators and functions to define the structure and logic:\n","\n","* **`@start()`**: Marks a method as a starting point for the Flow. Multiple methods can have this decorator, and they will run in parallel when the Flow begins.\n","* **`@listen(task_or_event)`**: Marks a method to execute when another specified task or method emits an output. The listener method receives the output as an argument.\n","* **`@router(method)`**: Defines conditional routing logic based on the output of a preceding method, allowing dynamic control over the execution path.\n","* **`or_(*methods)`**: Used within `@listen()` to trigger the listener if *any* of the specified methods emit an output.\n","    * Example: `@listen(or_(task_a, task_b))`\n","* **`and_(*methods)`**: Used within `@listen()` to trigger the listener only when *all* of the specified methods have emitted an output.\n","    * Example: `@listen(and_(task_a, task_b))`\n","\n","By using these components, you can create robust, interconnected, and stateful AI workflows with
