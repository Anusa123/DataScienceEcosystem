It enables efficient multi-agent workflows, where agents communicate, share information, and execute tasks with strategic coordination.\n",

        "- **Crew:** A collaborative team of AI agents working together towards a shared objective.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Key Attributes of an Agent**\n",
        "- **Role:** Defines the agent’s function (e.g., 'Analyst', 'Customer Service Rep').\n",
        "- **Goal:** Establishes the agent’s primary objective.\n",
        "- **Backstory:** Adds context and depth to an agent’s persona, improving interactions.\n",

        "CrewAI provides built-in tools for various functionalities, including:\n",
        "- **Web Scraping (ScrapeWebsiteTool):** Extracts data from websites.\n",
        "- **File Management (FileReadTool, FileWriteTool):** Reads and writes files.\n",
        "- **Database Interaction (PGSearchTool):** Connects agents to PostgreSQL databases, and searches related content from the database.\n",
        "- **Image Generation (DallETool):** Creates images using OpenAI’s DALL·E.\n",
        "- **Search Integration (SerperDevTool):** Conducts research with live web data.\n",

        "- **Entity Memory:** Captures structured data about people, places, or concepts.\n",
